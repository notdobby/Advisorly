## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Financial Vault app"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to GitHub.com
- Create new repository: `financial-vault`
- Don't initialize with README (we have one)

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/financial-vault.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Deploy to Hosting
- **Vercel** (Recommended): Connect GitHub repo → Deploy
- **Netlify**: Connect GitHub repo → Deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Enable in repository settings

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
In your hosting platform, add:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://wpnahamvfvcphtdbhsdb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

## 📋 Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:

- [ ] Environment variables in `.env` file
- [ ] README.md updated with your details

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
