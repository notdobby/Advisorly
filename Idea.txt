I have a plan of making a platform that will use Google for Authentication and once the user is logged in via Google, the GPay Account can be used. Small Wallets should be created instead of accessing the money from our back account. Like the date we are receiving our salary (Default: 1st of every month) and other details like Income, Name, etc. details should be asked while registering and stored in a highly secure database. When the user login (Highly secured method should be used), some percentage of the salary should be devoted, AI will give suggestions but it can be edited by the user like 20% for EMI, etc. This should be done wrt to the books written by great economist. After the % is devoted, the % should be converted to their country currency (Country should be asked while registering). Whenever the user do UPI payments, for e.g., if he buys groceries, then money from groceries will be deducted. At the end of the day, he can keep track of the money saved or spent. AI will give suggestions based on the spending of money by user and how it can be saved more efficiently. The UI should give vibes of a highly secured place where the money can be kept safely. All the transactions and stuff should be done by GPay. We will just verify the spending and give AI suggestions and stuffs. Is that possible?? If yes, give a clear description of the recommended tech stack for everything and how this can be achieved. Don't expect or give roadmap that will cost me, I need a free version of everything from designing the website to hosting it. Also If everyone needs to use it, then it should be available in app too but I don't know App development, so suggest some good options for making it available on phone like UPI apps (Not the Web to App one).
First give the detailed insights and then I'll say what to do.
